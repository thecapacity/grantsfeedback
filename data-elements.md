## Federal Grants Data Management Data Elements Feedback 

The Results-Oriented Accountability for Grants Cross Agency Priority Goal Team is soliciting feedback on the Federal Draft Grants Management Data Standards in order to develop and implement core grants management data standards and modernize information technology solutions. This information will be used to contribute to a future state where grants data are interoperable, there are fewer internal and public-facing grants management systems, and Federal awarding agencies and recipients leverage data to successfully implement a risk-based, data-driven approach to managing Federal grants. These draft data standards are a pre-decisional draft and should not be interpreted as setting policy or official guidance.
