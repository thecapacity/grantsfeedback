## Draft Data Elements

Many high-level civic data challenges have been identified in the past–archaic data management practices and IT legacy systems, issues with data sharing and interoperability, and a lack of secondary use considerations. But the Federal Government lacks an overall approach to tackle these challenges and prioritize data infrastructure improvements that serve the public. The Federal Data Strategy needs priority data Use Cases to ensure it is comprehensive and actionable.

## What is a Use Case?

For the purposes of the Federal Data Strategy, a “Use Case” is a data practice or method that leverages data to support an articulable federal agency mission or public interest outcome. The Federal Data Strategy is seeking examples that solve problems or demonstrate solutions that can help inform the four strategy areas: Enterprise Data Governance; Use, Access, and Augmentation; Decision-making and Accountability; and Commercialization, Innovation, and Public Use.
